This has both the raw csv files from kaggle as well as a couple of cleaned up files (removing rows that have missing data).

HTRU_2.csv is the dataset I used to train the models: https://www.kaggle.com/charitarth/pulsar-dataset-htru2 
pulsar_dataset_2.csv is one of the datasets I used to test our model: https://www.kaggle.com/colearninglounge/predicting-pulsar-starintermediate
cleaned_up_data_2.csv is a cleaned version of pulsar_dataset_2.csv becuase there were many rows with missing data.
